# Chris

- Completed the architecture and dataflow
[diagrams](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/186).
- Added an alternative build mode by having another main function. This is useful so
you can conveniently build the production version of the application from the command line,
instead of needing to edit any configuration files or use environment variables.
- Added more detailed comments to the codebase.
- Refactored and fixed the way we call
[SnackBars](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SnackBar-class.html)
in the latest version of flutter.
- Deleted the old backend commit history by pushing the code to a new (public)
repo. This is because there were some private credentials in the source code, but
I now use environment variables to determine those credentials.
- Added better mock testing to the backend code using the 'testify' go library.
- Added backend deployment guide to the README.md
