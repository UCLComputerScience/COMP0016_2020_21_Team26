# Chris

The main focus was implementing [user nudging](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/140).
This feature allows users to nudge other users in their network by setting them a
step goal. The receiver will get a notification and will be able to track their
progress. The reciever *and* sender will get a notification when the goal is met,
which provides some sort of accountability (you are motivated to walk since the
original sender will find out, when you have done so).

I also fixed some issue with sending network add links through SMS, and improve
performance using lazy loading of contact images.

## Next Steps

- Finish implementing flexible app bar on sharing page
- Integration/driver tests
- Readthedocs Hosted Documentation

# Saachi
I continued with polishing the app, separating the settings widgets into different pages and adding help buttons that rerun the tutorial. The client informed us that his steps were not being added to his graph after checkup so I worked on recreating this issue but was not able to. I am currently working on testing the network/sharing page.

## Next Steps
Complete network/sharing page tests and possibly add a launch screen.
