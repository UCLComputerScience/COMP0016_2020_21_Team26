# Saachi

This week, I worked on creating 2 figmas, one for general user flow and one to demonstrate the user flow of receiving a nudge. I also worked on reformatting the Support Network page and polishing the app.

## User Flow Figma
We received feedback that the app did not provide enough explanation as to how it should be used. Additionally, we need to demonstrate user flow on our project website. Therefore, I created a user flow figma that demonstrates the primary features on each page, and wrote out an explanation of these features for the client to review.  You can find this User Flow figma [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/53Di5ADgodaHYWmMHXB8xv/NudgeMe-User-Flow?node-id=59%3A49&scaling=scale-down).

## Nudge Figma
As our app is called NudgeMe, it is important for us to ensure the nudge feature is well-thought-out and interesting. To brainstorm and perfect this feature, I made a figma to represent this process and developed it into a user-nudge where people can set step challenges to those in their network. You can find this Nudge figma [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/Y5WnyJvxTJu0CvglLNgRSa/Nudge?node-id=0%3A3&scaling=min-zoom).

## Reformatting the Support Network page
I updated the app to match the description and new format of the user flow figma. I also added a tutorial slide before to explain what the page is for. There are still some features from the figma that need implementing so I will continue working on this. You can find the pr [here](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/135). 

## Polishing the app
I am currently working on implementing a scroll bar to indicate where the user can scroll down as tester feedback has suggested this is unclear. I also made some other changes. [Here is the pr](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/133).

## User manual 
I wrote a first draft for the user manual. I am planning to add screenshots and finishing touches once the app is complete. 

## Next Steps
This week, I will finish the support network page based on client feedback that we receive today, and polish the app a bit more. I will then work on the new user nudge feature.

Added a convenient alternative to sharing:
[sharing by contact selection](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/132).
This allows users to select multiple contacts to send the URL to at once.
It was implemented by using the "sms:" scheme that Android & iOS support.

## Next Steps

- Final big feature - user nudging.
- More widget testing
- Look into integration testing
