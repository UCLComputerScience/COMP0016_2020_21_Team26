As usual, there is often more detail in the PRs on the repo, e.g. screenshots.

# Chris

- Worked on adding [integration testing](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/163),
but there seems to be some unexpected behaviour on iOS so it may take a bit longer than usual.
- Added some quality of life [UI improvements](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/155),
such as adding an unread notification badge.
- [Added a setting](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/167)
that allows the user to toggle consent to share wellbeing data with the server.
- [Added search](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/159)
to the SMS/contacts page, as suggested by the client.
- Revisited and expanded [MoSCoW list](https://uclcomputerscience.github.io/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/about/).
- [Wrote a technical article](https://uclcomputerscience.github.io/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/2021/02/27/custom-painter-image.html)
on using CustomPainter with Flutter.
- Improved the development blog itself (included a proper Gemfile for customizability).

## Next Steps

- Add any more important test suites.
- Begin working on deliverables, e.g. improve documentation
and deployment guide.
- Possibly, start working on a research paper describing the architecture of
the system.

# Saachi

The client requested more changes to the language used in the app so I completed these. I also continued polishing the app, by fixing the settings page to display the current date and time of the scheduled checkup notification. Additionally, I tested Chris' additions on iOS and have been writing about our project for the  project website. 

## Next Steps

Finish the project website, start working on the 8-10 minute video and other deliverables.
