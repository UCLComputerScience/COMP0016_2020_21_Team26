# Saachi

This week, I finished the checkup screen. The [Fitkit package](https://pub.dev/packages/fit_kit) was causing an iOS permission problem,so I switched to the [Pedometer package](https://pub.dev/packages/pedometer) which was a lot easier to use. The FitKit package has less support and seems to be incompatible with iOS which is why I made the change.

## Next Week's Task

Next week, I will test the notification and look into how to turn user data into a PDF or JPG file.

I've converted the in-memory model of the user to a SQLite [persistent database](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/22). I've taken over Prav's assignment and researched the existing API, this helped me to decide how to structure the database. This also involved adding async loading to the graph, so now a nice loading spinner is displayed if it takes a while.

I also implemented the [publish screen](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/24) that POSTs to the API the last database record/week if the user accepts. Once the notifications are working we can enter this screen from notifications, but its just the settings page for now. I also added the local-differential private score.

## Next Week's Task

I will look into
- First Time Setup
- Integrating Notifications with publish screen
