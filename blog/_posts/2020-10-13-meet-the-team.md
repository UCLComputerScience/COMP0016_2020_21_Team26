## Chris
Greetings, I am Chris Tomy, a BSc Computer Science student in UCL (at the time of writing). I am an Emacs + EVIL user who enjoys occasionally tinkering with text editors. I currently don't have a specialisation in any particular programming language at the moment, and consider myself language-agnostic. Although I do like scripting in Python a fair bit.
I frequently play the electric guitar in my spare time.

You can have a look at my personal site [here](https://cyberchris.xyz/).
